# Github-Asset-Downloader
This allows you to download assets from multiple repositories and update them when possible.

Look through the code if you are suspecious of anything.

Setup notes:
1. If using the token it should look like this(github_pat******...).
2. When entering repos the template should be (0/Sanujsl/Github-Asset-Downloader) *the '0' represents the 1st file in a release.(you can put it as any number depending on which file you want).
